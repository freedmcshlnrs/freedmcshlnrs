Payday loans are expensive and no one in the world doubts that. The APR rates for payday loans can be as high as 4200%, definitely signaling that someone is making a fortune out of them.

However, the APR rate does not show the entire picture. Short-term lending is always expensive especially when the amount is ridiculously small. Imagine running a business with just a couple of employees. You will have to pay your employees, buy or rent a workplace, make necessary payments to government agencies for regulating your business, and spend money on advertising and marketing the business. With all these costs adding up to the value of service of product, there is going to be $10 margin for each unit to cover up the costs. The same thing happens when you borrow $200 from a payday loan lender. The lender charging $10 for the amount borrowed is actually paying for a place to work, for someone to process your loan, and for someone to receive the payments. This is the bare minimal setup for a payday loan lender, ignoring all the fees and marketing costs.
